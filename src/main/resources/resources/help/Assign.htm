<h2><a name="_Toc42878507">Assign</a></h2>

</div>

<p class=Main style='page-break-after:avoid'>The <span class=SimObjectChar>Assign</span>
object performs one or more <span class=SimObjectChar>Attribute</span>
assignments whenever it receives an incoming entity.  Once the assignments have
been performed, the received entity is passed to the next object without delay.</p>

<p class=Main style='page-break-after:avoid'>The <span class=SimObjectChar>Assign</span>
object is the only place where an <span class=SimObjectChar>Attribute</span>'s
value can be modified.  <span class=SimObjectChar>The Assign object can modify
the value of any attribute in the model: its own attributes, the received
entity's attributes, or any other object's attributes.</span></p>

<p class=Main style='page-break-after:avoid'><span class=SimObjectChar>The
attribute assignments to be performed are specified by the input to the </span><span
class=KeywordChar>AttributeAssignmentList</span> keyword.  Each assignment has
the following form:</p>

<p class=code>{ &lt;left-hand side expression&gt; = &lt;right-hand side
expression&gt; }</p>

<p class=Main>The right side of each assignment equation is an expression to be
evaluated.  The left side is an expression that identifies the attribute whose
value is to be modified.  For example, if object Assign1 has a dimensionless
numerical attribute A, then the following input to its <span class=KeywordChar>AttributeAssignmentList</span>
keyword causes the attribute to be increased by 1:</p>

<p class=code>{ 'this.A = this.A + 1' }</p>

<p class=Main>The Assign object attribute obj can be used to access the
attributes of the received entity.  For example, if the received entity has an
attribute B whose value is a string, then the following input to the <span
class=KeywordChar>AttributeAssignmentList</span> keyword causes this attribute
to take the value <span class=codeChar><span style='font-size:9.0pt'>'New
String'</span></span>:</p>

<p class=code>{ 'this.obj.B = [[New String]]' }</p>

<p class=Main>If another object, say Server1, has an attribute C whose value is
a number with units of distance, then the following input to the<span
class=KeywordChar> AttributeAssignmentList</span> keyword causes this attribute
to be increased by 1 kilometre:</p>

<p class=code>{ '[Server1].C = [Server1].C + 1[km]' }</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>An unlimited number of assignments can be performed by one
Assign object.</p>
