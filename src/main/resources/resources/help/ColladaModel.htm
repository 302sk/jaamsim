<h3>ColladaModel</h3>

<p class=Main style='page-break-after:avoid'><span class=SimObjectChar>ColladaModel</span>
objects are used to display custom 3D graphics in a simulation model.  The
COLLADA file format (.DAE) is an interchange file format used for 3D graphics. 
Any 3D object such as a <span class=SimObjectChar>DisplayEntity</span> and most
of its sub-classes can accept a <span class=SimObjectChar>ColladaModel</span>
as its <span class=SimObjectChar>DisplayModel</span>.</p>

<p class=Main style='page-break-after:avoid'>A number of other 3D formats can
be used in addition to Collada.  At the present time, JaamSim supports DAE,
OBJ, and JSB formats as well as zipped versions of these files (ZIP).  The JSB
format is specific to JaamSim:</p>

<p class=Main style='page-break-after:avoid'>The JSB format is a binary format
that allows complex 3D objects to be loaded much faster than is possible with
the DAE and OBJ formats.  A JSB file can be exported by right clicking on a <span
class=SimObjectChar>ColladaModel</span> in the Object Selector and selecting
&quot;Export 3D Binary File (*.jsb)&quot;.  Note that the exported JSB will
look for the same textures as the DAE file and that these should be located in
the same relative position to the JSB file as they were to the DAE file.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Managing 3D assets can be complicated because of the large
file sizes and the need to provide separate files for the textures.  It is
recommended that the user place each 3D asset and its texture files in its own
ZIP file.  This approach greatly reduces the number and size of the files being
handled, and ensures that the files can be moved between computers without
breaking the file paths.  Note that it is often necessary to edit the DAE file
with a text editor, such as Notepad++, to convert any absolute file paths for
texture files to relative ones.</p>
