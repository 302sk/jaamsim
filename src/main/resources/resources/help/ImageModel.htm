<h3>ImageModel</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=SimObjectChar>ImageModel</span> objects are used
to display custom 2D graphics in a simulation model, such as a picture or a
map.  Both <span class=SimObjectChar>DisplayEntity</span> and <span
class=SimObjectChar>OverlayImage</span> can accept an ImageModel object as an
input.  Image file types currently supported by JaamSim include BMP, GIF, JPG,
PCX and PNG files, or a ZIP file containing any one of these file types.</p>
