<p class=Main style='page-break-after:avoid'>The <span class=SimObjectChar>SimEntity</span>
object is the basic entity that is passed through a process flow type model.</p>

<p class=Main>The main feature of <span class=SimObjectChar>SimEntity</span> is
that its state can be assigned at various stages of the process flow.  Process
Flow objects that can receive a <span class=SimObjectChar>SimEntity</span>,
such as <span class=SimObjectChar>Server</span> and <span class=SimObjectChar>Queue</span>,
can assign a state to the received <span class=SimObjectChar>SimEntity</span>
using their <span class=KeywordChar>StateAssignment</span> keyword. For
example, if the <span class=KeywordChar>StateAssignment</span> input for a <span
class=SimObjectChar>Queue</span> is set to &quot;Waiting&quot;, then the state
for each <span class=SimObjectChar>SimEntity</span> received by the <span
class=SimObjectChar>Queue</span> will be set to &quot;Waiting&quot; when it
arrives at the <span class=SimObjectChar>Queue</span>.  The <span
class=SimObjectChar>SimEntity</span> will remain in this state until it is set
to a new state by a subsequent object.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The time spent a <span class=SimObjectChar>SimEntity</span>
in each state can be accessed using its <span class=KeywordChar>StateTimes</span>
output.  For example, the total time spent by the <span class=SimObjectChar>SimEntity</span>
in the state &quot;Waiting&quot; is given by <span class=codeChar><span
style='font-size:9.0pt'>StateTimes(&quot;Waiting&quot;)</span></span>.</p>
