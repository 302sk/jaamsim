the position and direction of the camera that creates the 3D image in a View
window.</p>

<p class=Main style='page-break-after:avoid'>A new View can be created by
clicking on the View item in the Menu bar.  An existing View can be selected
for editing by clicking on its entry in the Object Selector.  Views can be
copied, pasted, renamed, or deleted in the same way as other objects in the Object
Selector.  However, a renamed View must be closed and re-opened before its new
name is displayed.</p>
